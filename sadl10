Sign in to GitHub.

Click your profile → Settings.

Left menu → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token (choose Fine-grained token or Classic if only Classic shown).

Give it a name (e.g., lab-token-<date>).

Set an expiry (30 or 90 days is fine for practice).

Select minimal scopes:

For repo push/pull: repo (or in fine-grained: repo-specific Read & write).

Click Generate token.

Copy the token now (you will not see it again). Save it in a password manager or a temporary secure place for the exam.



Step 2: Open your project folder in terminal
cd path/to/your/project

🧩 Step 3: Initialize and commit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

🧩 Step 4: Connect to GitHub using HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git

🧩 Step 5: Push using the PAT
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


When asked:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste your PAT

🎉 If it pushes successfully → you’ve demonstrated secure authentication.
